## Securing App Configurations

After a brief overview of Azure App Configuration on the previous page, it's time to get to know the service a bit better. 

To refresh your memory, Azure App Configuration is a service aimed at general configuration management and controlling application features. It's all about operational efficiency and ensuring consistency across various deployments.

Azure App Configuration stores configuration data as key-value pairs. In practice, it means that it organizes and manages configuration settings in a simple, yet effective format. In this system keys are unique identifiers for a configuration setting, whereas value represents actual configuration data or setting associated with the key.

For example, if you have a setting for an application's background color, the key might be `BackgroundColor`, and the value could be `#FFFFFF` for white.

### Paired Keys and Values
</edukamu-collapse-hidden-title>

Azure App Configuration stores configuration data as key-value pairs.

### Keys

Keys serve as the name for key-value pairs and are used to store and retrieve corresponding values. It's a common practice to organize keys into a hierarchical namespace by using a character delimiter, such as `/` or `:`. Use a convention that's best suited for your application. App Configuration treats keys as a whole. It doesn't parse keys to figure out how their names are structured or enforce any rule on them.

Keys stored in App Configuration are case-sensitive, unicode-based strings. The keys *app1* and *App1* are distinct in an App Configuration store. Keep this in mind when you use configuration settings within an application because some frameworks handle configuration keys case-insensitively.

You can use any unicode character in key names entered into App Configuration except for `*`, `,`, and `\.` These characters are reserved. If you need to include a reserved character, you must escape it by using `\{Reserved Character}`. There's a combined size limit of 10,000 characters on a key-value pair. This limit includes all characters in the key, its value, and all associated optional attributes. Within this limit, you can have many hierarchical levels for keys.

### Designing Key Namespaces

There are two general approaches to naming keys used for configuration data: flat or hierarchical. These methods are similar from an application usage standpoint, but hierarchical naming offers many advantages:

- Easier to read. Instead of one long sequence of characters, delimiters in a hierarchical key name function as spaces in a sentence.
- Easier to manage. A key name hierarchy represents logical groups of configuration data.
- Easier to use. It's simpler to write a query that pattern-matches keys in a hierarchical structure and retrieves only a portion of configuration data.

Following are some examples of how you can structure your key names into a hierarchy:

- Based on component services:

```Code
AppName:Service1:ApiEndpoint
AppName:Service2:ApiEndpoint
```

- Based on deployment regions:

```Code
AppName:Region1:DbEndpoint
AppName:Region2:DbEndpoint
```

<!-- ### Label Keys

Key values in App Configuration can optionally have a label attribute. Labels are used to differentiate key values with the same key. A key *app1* with labels *A* and *B* forms two separate keys in an App Configuration store. By default, the label for a key value is empty, or `null`.

Label provides a convenient way to create variants of a key. A common use of labels is to specify multiple environments for the same key:

```Code
Key = AppName:DbEndpoint & Label = Test
Key = AppName:DbEndpoint & Label = Staging
Key = AppName:DbEndpoint & Label = Production
``` -->

### Version Key Values

Key values in App Configuration can optionally have a label attribute. Labels are used to differentiate key values with the same key. A key *app1* with labels *A* and *B* forms two separate keys in an App Configuration store. By default, the label for a key value is empty, or `null`.

Label provides a convenient way to create variants of a key. A common use of labels is to specify multiple environments for the same key:

```Code
Key = AppName:DbEndpoint & Label = Test
Key = AppName:DbEndpoint & Label = Staging
Key = AppName:DbEndpoint & Label = Production
```

### Query Key Values

App Configuration doesn't version key values automatically as they're modified. Use labels as a way to create multiple versions of a key value. For example, you can input an application version number or a Git commit ID in labels to identify key values associated with a particular software build.

### Values

Values assigned to keys are also unicode strings. You can use all unicode characters for values. There's an optional user-defined content type associated with each value. Use this attribute to store information, for example an encoding scheme, about a value that helps your application to process it properly.

Configuration data stored in an App Configuration store, which includes all keys and values, is encrypted at rest and in transit. App Configuration isn't a replacement solution for Azure Key Vault. Don't store application secrets in it.

Paired keys and values provide a clear and straightforward method to manage configuration settings. In this approach, each distinct setting is represented by a key, and its corresponding value can easily be retrieved or modified using that key.

The structure described is especially useful for cloud applications, in which configurations often need to be dynamic and easily accessible from different parts of the application. This also highlights the usability of Azure App Configuration - it can be used with all kinds of applications!

All right, let's see how the service handles managing application features and securing app configuration data.

### Managing Application Features with App Configuration
</edukamu-collapse-hidden-title>

Feature management is a modern software-development practice that decouples feature release from code deployment and enables quick changes to feature availability on demand. It uses a technique called feature flags (also known as feature toggles, feature switches, and so on) to dynamically administer a feature's lifecycle.

### Basic Concepts

Here are several new terms related to feature management:

- **Feature flag**: A feature flag is a variable with a binary state of on or off. The feature flag also has an associated code block. The state of the feature flag triggers whether the code block runs or not.
- **Feature manager**: A feature manager is an application package that handles the lifecycle of all the feature flags in an application. The feature manager typically provides extra functionality, such as caching feature flags and updating their states.
- **Filter**: A filter is a rule for evaluating the state of a feature flag. A user group, a device or browser type, a geographic location, and a time window are all examples of what a filter can represent.

An effective implementation of feature management consists of at least two components working in concert:

- An application that makes use of feature flags.
- A separate repository that stores the feature flags and their current states.

The interaction of these components is illustrated in the following examples.


### Feature Flag Usage in Code

The basic pattern for implementing feature flags in an application is simple. You can think of a feature flag as a Boolean state variable used with an `if` conditional statement in your code:

C#

```C#
if (featureFlag) {
    // Run the following code
}
```

In this case, if `featureFlag` is set to `True`, the enclosed code block is executed; otherwise, it's skipped. You can set the value of `featureFlag` statically, as in the following code example:

C#

```C#
bool featureFlag = true;
```

You can also evaluate the flag's state based on certain rules:

C#

```C#
bool featureFlag = isBetaUser();
```

A slightly more complicated feature flag pattern includes an `else` statement as well:

C#

```C#
if (featureFlag) {
    // This following code will run if the featureFlag value is true
} else {
    // This following code will run if the featureFlag value is false
}
```

### Feature Flag Declaration

Each feature flag has two parts: a name and a list of one or more filters that are used to evaluate if a feature's state is *on* (that is, when its value is `True`). A filter defines a use case for when a feature should be turned on.

When a feature flag has multiple filters, the filter list is traversed in order until one of the filters determines the feature should be enabled. At that point, the feature flag is *on*, and any remaining filter results are skipped. If no filter indicates the feature should be enabled, the feature flag is *off*.

The feature manager supports *appsettings.json* as a configuration source for feature flags. The following example shows how to set up feature flags in a JSON file:

JSON

```JSON
"FeatureManagement": {
    "FeatureA": true, // Feature flag set to on
    "FeatureB": false, // Feature flag set to off
    "FeatureC": {
        "EnabledFor": [
            {
                "Name": "Percentage",
                "Parameters": {
                    "Value": 50
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Feature Flag Repository

To use feature flags effectively, you need to externalize all the feature flags used in an application. This approach allows you to change feature flag states without modifying and redeploying the application itself.

Azure App Configuration is designed to be a centralized repository for feature flags. You can use it to define different kinds of feature flags and manipulate their states quickly and confidently. You can then use the App Configuration libraries for various programming language frameworks to easily access these feature flags from your application.

### Securing App Configuration Data
</edukamu-collapse-hidden-title>

There are three main approaches to securing apps configuration data with Azure App configuration: 1) customer-managed keys, 2) private endpoint, and 3) managed identities, which we already covered before.

### 1. Customer-managed Keys

Azure App Configuration encrypts sensitive information at rest using a 256-bit AES encryption key provided by Microsoft. Every App Configuration instance has its own encryption key managed by the service and used to encrypt sensitive information. Sensitive information includes the values found in key-value pairs. When customer-managed key capability is enabled, App Configuration uses a managed identity assigned to the App Configuration instance to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID.

The managed identity then calls Azure Key Vault and wraps the App Configuration instance's encryption key. The wrapped encryption key is then stored and the unwrapped encryption key is cached within App Configuration for one hour. App Configuration refreshes the unwrapped version of the App Configuration instance's encryption key hourly. This ensures availability under normal operating conditions.

#### Enabling Customer-managed Key Capabilities:

The following components are required to successfully enable the customer-managed key capability for Azure App Configuration:

- Standard tier Azure App Configuration instance.
- Azure Key Vault with soft-delete and purge-protection features enabled.
- An RSA or RSA-HSM key within the Key Vault: The key must not be expired, it must be enabled, and it must have both wrap and unwrap capabilities enabled.

Once these resources are configured, two steps remain to allow Azure App Configuration to use the Key Vault key:

1. Assign a managed identity to the Azure App Configuration instance.
2. Grant the identity `GET`, `WRAP`, and `UNWRAP` permissions in the target Key Vault's access policy.

### 2. Private Endpoints

You can use private endpoints for Azure App Configuration to allow clients on a virtual network (VNet) to securely access data over a private link. The private endpoint uses an IP address from the VNet address space for your App Configuration store. Network traffic between the clients on the VNet and the App Configuration store traverses over the VNet using a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure to the public internet.

Using private endpoints for your App Configuration store enables you to:

- Secure your application configuration details by configuring the firewall to block all connections to App Configuration on the public endpoint.
- Increase security for the virtual network (VNet) ensuring data doesn't escape from the VNet.
- Securely connect to the App Configuration store from on-premises networks that connect to the VNet using VPN or ExpressRoutes with private-peering.

### 3. Managed Identities

A managed identity from Microsoft Entra ID allows Azure App Configuration to easily access other Microsoft Entra ID-protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault. The identity is managed by the Azure platform. It doesn't require you to provision or rotate any secrets.

Your application can be granted two types of identities:

- A **system-assigned identity** is tied to your configuration store. It's deleted if your configuration store is deleted. A configuration store can only have one system-assigned identity.
- A **user-assigned identity** is a standalone Azure resource that can be assigned to your configuration store. A configuration store can have multiple user-assigned identities.

#### a. System-assigned Identities

To set up a managed identity using the Azure CLI, use the `az appconfig identity assign` command against an existing configuration store. The following Azure CLI example creates a system-assigned identity for an Azure App Configuration store named `myTestAppConfigStore`.

Bash

```Bash
az appconfig identity assign \ 
    --name myTestAppConfigStore \ 
    --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

#### b. User-assigned Identities

Creating an App Configuration store with a user-assigned identity requires that you create the identity and then assign its resource identifier to your store. The following Azure CLI examples create a user-assigned identity called `myUserAssignedIdentity` and assign it to an Azure App Configuration store named `myTestAppConfigStore`.

Create an identity using the `az identity create` command:

Bash

```Bash
az identity create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myUserAssignedIdentity
```

Assign the new user-assigned identity to the `myTestAppConfigStore` configuration store:

Bash

```Bash
az appconfig identity assign --name myTestAppConfigStore \ 
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \ 
    --identities /subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myUserAssignedIdentity
```
